## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Volume Detection Issues

**Problem:** Script fails to detect volumes

**Solutions:**

- Ensure you're in Recovery Mode (not booted into macOS normally)
- Verify macOS is installed on your drive
- Check your drive is visible in Disk Utility
- Try the original version (legacy, hardcoded volume names):

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MedFaji/MDM/main/handle-it.sh -o handle-it.sh && chmod +x ./handle-it.sh && ./handle-it.sh
```

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Permission denied errors

**Solutions:**

- Confirm you're running from Terminal in Recovery Mode
- Recovery Mode automatically provides elevated privileges
- Make sure the script is executable: `chmod +x handle-it.sh`

### Script Won't Execute

**Problem:** Script doesn't run

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Make sure it's executable
chmod +x handle-it.sh

# Run it again
./handle-it.sh
```

### Invalid Username or Password

**Problem:** Script rejects your username/password

**Validation Rules:**

- **Username:** Letters, numbers, underscore, hyphen only; must start with letter or underscore
- **Password:** Minimum 4 characters
- Press Enter to use defaults if unsure

## ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer

> **Important:** Although it's virtually impossible to detect that you've removed MDM (because it was never configured locally), be aware that your device's serial number will still appear in your organization's inventory system. This script prevents MDM from being configured locally, making the device unmanageable remotely.
